Hereâ€™s a **detailed breakdown of Week 1 (Day-by-Day)** tasks for your supermarket POS system project using **React (Frontend)** and **FastAPI (Backend)**. This plan assumes WyneZ is working solo with about **4â€“6 hours per day**.

## âœ… **Week 1: Core Setup & Backend API Foundation**

### ðŸ”¹ **Day 1 â€“ Project Initialization**

**Goal**: Set up development environments, Git repos, and structure both frontend and backend.

* [ ] Create two GitHub repositories:

  * `pos-backend-fastapi`
  * `pos-frontend-react`
* [ ] Initialize FastAPI project:

  * Use `poetry` or `pipenv`
  * Setup folder structure (`app/`, `routers/`, `models/`, etc.)
* [ ] Initialize React project with Vite or CRA

  * Set up file structure: `components/`, `pages/`, `services/`
* [ ] Set up basic README files and push to GitHub
* [ ] Setup `.env` for secrets, and `.gitignore`

### ðŸ”¹ **Day 2 â€“ Database Design & Models**

**Goal**: Define and build core DB models and relationships.

* [ ] Design schema for:

  * `User`, `Product`, `Category`, `Inventory`, `Sale`, `SaleItem`
* [ ] Use SQLAlchemy + Alembic for migration
* [ ] Create DB connection utility
* [ ] Migrate database and seed sample products

> ðŸ’¡ You can also create a local `dev.db` using SQLite for speed.

### ðŸ”¹ **Day 3 â€“ Auth System**

**Goal**: Add secure JWT-based login for staff/admin.

* [ ] Install `fastapi-users` or implement custom login system
* [ ] Create endpoints:

* [ ] Endpoints:

  * `GET /products`
  * `GET /products/{id}`

  * `PUT /products/{id}`
  * `GET /categories`
* [ ] Add basic filtering/search (by name, category)
* [ ] Inventory tracking:

  * `quantity`, `low_stock_alert`

### ðŸ”¹ **Day 5 â€“ Sales & Cart Logic**

**Goal**: Enable sale creation and prepare data flow for POS.
