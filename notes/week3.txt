## ✅ **Week 3: Advanced Features, Testing & Deployment**

---

### 🔹 **Day 11 – Discount, Returns, and Refund Logic**

**Goal**: Enable discounts and simple return/refund processing.

* [ ] Update cart UI to allow:

  * Percentage or fixed-amount discounts per item or entire cart
* [ ] Backend: Extend `/sales` endpoint to accept discounts
* [ ] Create “Returns” page:

  * Search past sale by ID
  * Select items to return
  * Backend: Create `POST /returns` or `PATCH /sales/{id}/return`
* [ ] Inventory auto-restock on return

---

### 🔹 **Day 12 – Role-based Access & Admin Features**

**Goal**: Different access levels for cashier vs admin.

* [ ] Backend: Ensure endpoints are protected by role (admin/cashier)
* [ ] Frontend:

  * Only show reports/settings to admin
  * Cashiers restricted to POS and sales pages
* [ ] Add user management UI for admins (optional):

  * View users
  * Reset password

---

### 🔹 **Day 13 – Reporting Dashboard**

**Goal**: Provide an analytics view of sales performance.

* [ ] Backend:

  * `GET /reports/sales?from=...&to=...`
  * Return total sales, top products, revenue, etc.
* [ ] Frontend:

  * Graphs with `Recharts` or `Chart.js`
  * Filters by date range
  * Total revenue, # of transactions, top 5 products

---

### 🔹 **Day 14 – Testing & Bug Fixes**

**Goal**: Add coverage and catch breaking issues.

* [ ] Backend tests:

  * Use `pytest` for key endpoints (`products`, `sales`, `auth`)
* [ ] Frontend:

  * Manual UI tests
  * Optionally add `Vitest` or `Jest` for cart logic
* [ ] Fix any 404s, race conditions, bad error handling

---

### 🔹 **Day 15 – Deployment & Documentation**

**Goal**: Finalize deployment and handoff assets.

* [ ] Deploy backend (Render, Railway, or VPS)
* [ ] Deploy frontend (Vercel, Netlify, or serve via FastAPI)
* [ ] Add `.env.example`, README setup instructions
* [ ] Final UI polishing:

  * Responsive layout
  * Mobile-friendly tweaks
* [ ] Record short video demo or screenshots
* [ ] Prepare handover or client pitch deck (optional)
