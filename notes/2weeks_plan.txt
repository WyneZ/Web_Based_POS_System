Great choice! Combining **React** (frontend) with **FastAPI** (backend) is a modern and scalable stack — ideal for a Point of Sale (POS) system.

Here’s a clear and achievable **project flow and 2-week plan** for building your **supermarket POS system**, including real-time functionality (e.g., printing, QR scanning).

---

## 🧭 PROJECT FLOW

### 1. **Frontend (React)**

* Authentication (login/logout)
* Product search (QR/barcode input)
* Shopping cart (add/remove/update items)
* Checkout and payment
* Sales history
* Receipt printing (or preview)
* Inventory view (optional)

### 2. **Backend (FastAPI)**

* User authentication (JWT)
* Product CRUD + barcode/QR endpoint
* Inventory tracking and logs
* Sales and payments API
* WebSocket for real-time (e.g., printer, stock updates)
* Admin panel (optional, or via 3rd party like Supabase/Hasura)

### 3. **Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)**

* With SQLAlchemy ORM models (shared earlier)

---

## 🗓️ 2-WEEK PLAN (Agile Sprints)

### ✅ **Day 1–2: Setup + Planning**

* ✅ Define feature scope & priority
* ✅ Setup GitHub repo with monorepo or 2 folders:

  ```
  /backend   (FastAPI)
  /frontend  (React)
  ```
* ✅ Initialize FastAPI project with SQLAlchemy, Alembic, JWT
* ✅ Initialize React with Vite or CRA + Tailwind

---

### ✅ **Day 3–5: Core Backend APIs**

* ✅ Create DB models:

  * `User`, `Product`, `Inventory`, `Sale`, `SaleItem`, `Payment`
* ✅ Implement:

  * `/auth/login`, `/auth/me` (JWT)
  * `/products/` (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
  * `/sales/` (create a sale)
  * `/inventory/` (stock management)
* ✅ Test via Swagger + Postman

---

### ✅ **Day 6–7: Core Frontend Pages**

* ✅ Login page (JWT-based auth)
* ✅ Product list/search + QR input
* ✅ Cart logic (add, remove, update)
* ✅ Checkout screen
* ✅ Basic receipt layout

---

### ✅ **Day 8–10: Real-Time + Finishing Core**

* ✅ WebSocket connection for printer queue
* ✅ Auto-print receipt after checkout
* ✅ Stock update on sale
* ✅ Confirm QR/barcode scan workflow
* ✅ Finalize payment flow

---

### ✅ **Day 11–13: Polish + Testing**

* ✅ Improve UI/UX with Tailwind components
* ✅ Add validation, loading states
* ✅ Write unit tests for backend
* ✅ Test POS on tablet / printer / QR scanner

---

### ✅ **Day 14: Deployment + Wrap Up**

* ✅ Deploy backend (Railway, Render, or local server)
* ✅ Deploy frontend (Netlify/Vercel or local)
* ✅ Setup `.env`, Docker (optional)
* ✅ Create README and usage guide
* ✅ Collect feedback from real cashier/store test

---

## 🧠 Bonus Features (Future Scope)

* Role-based admin panel (manager vs cashier)
* Multi-terminal/store support
* Customer loyalty integration
* Offline mode (sync when reconnected)
* Analytics dashboard (daily/weekly sales)
